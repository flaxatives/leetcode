# Leetcode
This is a collection of my solutions to Leetcode problems, done in Python. This
isn't complete, as I haven't done all 100+ problems. These are the ones I've had
already in files to put in this repo. More solutions can be found on my blog at
flaxatives.com/blog.

Also, these aren't plug-n-play right into the Leetcode judge. You'd need to put
them into a class, and not all of the algorithms have been optimized (i.e. the
dynamic programming solutions), just because you should learn how to do it
yourself, or it'd just look less readable with optimization.
